  What makes a good scientist great is creativity with data, skepticism
  and good communication skills. Getting all of that together in the
  same person is difficult -- because traditionally, different people
  follow different paths in their careers -- some are more technical,
  others are more creative and communicative. A data scientist has to
  have both.
