  In my view, success for data science professionals relies on becoming
  trained and able data scientists with the ability to perform data
  processing and computation at a massive scale. To achieve this,
  professionals must invest time in ongoing education through
  institutions with multidisciplinary programs that include elements
  from engineering, mathematical sciences, and social
  sciences. Converting big data into meaningful information begins with
  skilled professionals who are educated in all disciplines to be both
  data scientists and statisticians.
