  I think of data science as more like a practice than a job. Think of
  the scientific method, where you have to have a problem statement,
  generate a hypothesis, collect data, analyze data and then communicate
  the results and take action. If you just use the scientific method as
  a way to approach data-intensive projects, I think youâ€™re more apt to
  be successful with your outcome.
